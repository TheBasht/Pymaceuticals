### Analysis

- The average tumor volume for mice treated with the Capomulin regimen ranges from approximately 34.56 mm3 to 45.80 mm3, suggesting Capomulin's effectiveness in controlling tumor growth.

- The correlation coefficient between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen is 0.84, indicating a strong positive correlation. This suggests that heavier mice tend to have larger tumor volumes under this treatment.

- Capomulin and Ramicane regimens show lower median tumor volumes compared to Infubinol and Ceftamin in the box plot analysis, indicating these treatments might be more effective in reducing tumor sizes.
